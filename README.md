# TypeScript-Node-Starter

## Run
### To develop, we run:
- npm run watch-ts
##### and in a separate terminal we run:
- npm run watch-node
##### and then opening the url http://localhost:3000/ in a browser we can see the output of the application.
If we update the server.js source, the application is recompiled and restarted; reloading the browser will reflect the change.
